# Week 04 Assignment - Build an Accessible Image Gallery

Welcome to my reflection about my week 04 assignment, where I've created an accesible image gallery.

## what did i achieve ?

I created a super mario themed image gallery containing 5 images which pop forward once hovered over the thumbnail-container, left and right buttons to resemble a nintendo joypad to navigate through images which make a coin collection noise once clicked, and a background audio of a stage taken from a super mario game. 

I made use of adding aria-labels to the audio control, thumbnail container & left/right buttons, also adding media queries to the thumbnail container and background image to optimise for multiple devices. 

## What could i improve ?

I found using media queries, i wasnt loosing any part of the picture as the page size decreased however i would have liked the background image to keep the same height to appear to sit behind the thumbnail container, but was unsure how to make these alterations.

I found i could add aria labels to all of the above, but could not add them to each individual picture as they were in my java.

To finish it off i would have liked to add a custom super mario skin audio player with multiple tracks to match the theme of the page.
